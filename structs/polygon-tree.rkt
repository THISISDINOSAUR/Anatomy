            point on parent minus its parent rotated by total angle (up to and including parent angle)
            add child angle to total angle

                rotate child-point about total angle? (I can't decide if conceptually this should be part of it)
                    (it feels like the angle definitely needs to include the child angle to make the most scale-point-dimension-wise    
                    which would then mean the point should also inclue the child point)
                    I think to decide I need to think about how I actually use this information
                    e.g. to render a polygon, which position do you need?

                    I'm leaning towards it should include this
