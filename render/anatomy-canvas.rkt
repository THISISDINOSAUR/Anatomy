;TODO add edit mode where you can drag points

;TODO draw mode without a bone selected (maybe with origin at the cursor). Not sure what to do about rotation tho
;TODO NEXT solve the rotation problem
;I guess you need to know the absolute rotation of the parent?
; we should ahve that info through drawable-polygon.original-placement
; maybe you select a bone, and then press a different key (a?) and that gives you the mouse relative drawing

;Maybe instead of giving the rotation like taht, It should draw in the space of that bone, but with the mouse as the origin


;gaps in bones?
;soft body
